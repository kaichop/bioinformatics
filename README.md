## Introduction

Lab members and collaborators developed a number of bioinformatics software tools for the analysis of genomics data sets. These tools are available at [WGLab GitHub repositories](https://github.com/WGLab/). My lab webpage can be accessed [here](http://wglab.org), and my publication list can be accessed [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=J_veo1sAAAAJ&hl=en).
