## Introduction

I am an Associate Professor at Columbia University Medical Center. My research focused on the development of bioinformatics tools to facilitate the implementation of genomic medicine. My lab webpage can be accessed [here](http://wglab.org), and my publication list can be accessed [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=J_veo1sAAAAJ&hl=en).

Lab members and collaborators developed a number of bioinformatics software tools for the analysis of genomics data sets, available at [WGLab GitHub repositories](https://github.com/WGLab/).
