## Introduction

I am a principal investigator in a [genomics lab](http://genomics.usc.edu) at the University of Southern California. Lab members and collaborators developed a number of bioinformatics software tools for analysis of genomics data sets (see list [here](http://openbioinformatics.org/)). The source code for some of these tools that we developed are available at [WGLab GitHub repositories](https://github.com/WGLab/).
